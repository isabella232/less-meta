## What is this?

This repo was created to have a place to discuss issues related to organization, planning or 
other "meta" issues _not directly related to the code base_. 

We will have _some_ code-related discussions here, but for high-level planning and long-term roadmap. Aside from that, 
most of the issues will relate to topics like:  

* volunteering and contributing
* community projects and involvement
* other non-code discussions and ideas

Thanks for taking an interest, and please feel comfortable adding your voice to the discussions here!
