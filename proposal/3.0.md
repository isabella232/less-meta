3.0 Roadmap Proposal  - WIP document
====
* Fixing "strict math" to resolve division ambiguities (https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1880)
* Addressing variable scope for mixin calls/definitions and callers (https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2767, https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/996)
* Aligning behavior & definition of mixins and detached rulesets (https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2767, https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1859)
* Namespace referencing (https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1848), which also might relate to mixin / DR scope
* [Simplifying the Less API](api.md)

Many of these are breaking changes or relate to breaking changes, hence targeting it for a full point release.
