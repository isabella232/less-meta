3.0 Roadmap Proposal  - WIP document
====
Some possible items to address for 3.0.
* Fixing "strict math" to resolve division ambiguities (#1880)
* Addressing variable scope for mixin calls/definitions and callers (#2767, #996)
* Aligning behavior & definition of mixins and detached rulesets (#2767, #1859)
* Namespace referencing (#1848), which also might relate to mixin / DR scope
* Simplifying the Less API

Many of these are breaking changes or relate to breaking changes, hence targeting it for a full point release.
